class Graph:
    '''
    In order to implement a Graph as an Adjacency List what we need to do is define the methods our Adjacency List object will have:
    Graph() creates a new, empty graph.
    addVertex(vert) adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.
    addEdge(fromVert, toVert) Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
    addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
    getVertex(vertKey) finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.
    getVertices() returns the list of all vertices in the graph.
    in returns True for a statement of the form vertex in graph, if the given vertex is in the graph, False otherwise.
